This repository includes the code used for the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.03301 to find improved lower bounds for van der Waerden numbers. This was a distributed computing project creating used BOINC. That paper provides full details. This README file provides information on compiling and running the code.

Compiling the code requires checking out the full BOINC repository. However, the code unique to this project resides in a single cpp file, uc2.cpp.
